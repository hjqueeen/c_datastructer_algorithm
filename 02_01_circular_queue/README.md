# Circular Queue Implementation in C

This C program demonstrates the implementation of a circular queue using an array. It provides a basic command-line interface for users to enqueue, dequeue, and print the contents of the circular queue.

## Features

- *Add Number (Enqueue):* Allows users to add a number to the circular queue.
- *Dequeue:* Removes the front element from the circular queue.
- *Print Queue:* Displays the current contents of the circular queue.
- *Program End:* Exits the program.

## Usage

1. *Add Number (Enqueue):*
   - Select option 1.
   - Enter the number to be added to the circular queue.

2. *Dequeue:*
   - Select option 2.

3. *Print Queue:*
   - Select option 3 to display the current contents of the circular queue.

4. *Program End:*
   - Select option 0 to end the program.

## How to Run

Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):


## Notes

- The circular queue has a maximum size defined by MAX_SIZE in the program.
- If the circular queue is full, attempting to add more elements will display an error message.
